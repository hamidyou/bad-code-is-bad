# Level Two

Welcome to Level Two! I hope level one was a fun little experiment for you, (unless you skipped it of course you monster)

The same rules and thought process will apply here as it did in level one. You are free to make your own changes with no restraint, just make sure you output what is expected in a similar manner.

We may also introduce Locked code blocks here (These will just be blocks of code you're not allowed to edit/change probably just test runners)

Good luck & Have fun!
