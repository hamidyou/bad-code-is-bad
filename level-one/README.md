# Level One

Pretty basic setup make the code better, and post your solutions to the "solved" folder. Sure you can peak at others work, however how will you know if thats the best way to do things?

And above that, how will you learn to make it better yourself, or what to look for?

These challenges involve basic ES6+ front-end examples

Good luck!
