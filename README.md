Bad Code on display

The idea is the code works if you run it out of the box. (In most instances)

However how can you make it better?

Don't only focus on "performance" but also readability and standards, does this code meet what you'd consider your own standards? Is it readable? Is it easily mutated or not pure?

## Prime Objectives

- Is it readable?
- Does it meet a level of standards you agree with?
- Is it mutating?
- If mutation is a MUST is it doing it in a safe way?
- Are the function pure in form and preventing mutation?
- Is this the best way?
