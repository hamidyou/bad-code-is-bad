Bad Code on display

The idea is the code works if you run it out of the box. (In most instances)

However how can you make it better?

## Prime Objectives

- Is it readable?
- Does it meet a level of standards you agree with?
- Is it mutating?
- If mutation is a MUST is it doing it in a safe way?
- Are the function pure in form and preventing mutation?
- Is this the best way?
